"I wrote notes in a classified secret room for my military school once.  The notes were automatically labeled as secret because of the room we were in even though the lesson being taught was unclassified. So, I had to wait for them to ""scrub"" my notes before taking them back to my work so I could use them. 

My point here is, yes, it is extremely easy to take home classified documents. I didn't have to wait, I could have just accidentally forgot and kept it in my pocket. I'm not trying to come into the defense of people who have monkey loads of documents here, but I'd imagine that everything a vice president or president does is automatically labeled as classified until deemed otherwise. So, it's an acceptable assumption to make that this would indeed affect everyone.

"""Top Secret"" literally means ""do not take this home.""  

I understand that most of the time they aren't really important.  But how hard is to *not* take home the documents clearly labeled ""do not take home"" in bright red ink?

I've never had a security clearance, but I've worked in multiple jobs where we had paperwork that wasn't to be taken home or left in the open.  (Privacy issues.)  And guess what?  I *didn't* take those papers home.  *No one* took those papers home.  Not even our stupidest trainees had a problem with ""do not remove from premises"" documents.  The guy who *glued his hand to a railing* didn't have a problem with following those instructions.  The new girl who mixed bleach and ammonia and caused the whole building to be evacuated didn't have trouble with those instructions.

I'm sorry if I expect better from our elected officials and *our freaking president* than I did from the moron who managed to get his arm stuck in a blood pressure cuff and somehow decided that *cutting off the cuff* was a better solution than unfastening the velcro.

Secondly, it's a low-altitude flight, very detectable, hence not a great ""spy vessel"". If we wanted to troll, we could even fake troop movements, equipment inventory, etc. to make it look like we have military installations and/or equipment in places we don't.

"It’s at like 90,000 feet iirc and balloons have basically no infrared signature (like a satellite does). So they’re actually hard to aim at. The highest an F22 goes is supposedly under 70,000 feet.

"Answer: The three reasons that have been given for why it’s not being shot down are:

1.	⁠It’s floating above and outside of commercial airspace, and doesn’t pose a risk to aircraft.
2.	⁠It’s believed to be significantly less capable than Chinese spy satellites, and there’s little risk in it collecting any information they don’t already have.

This also isn't the first time they've done this, happened a few times, including under the previous administration.

#EDIT

I put this in another comment but I'm gonna hijack this one since it's higher in the chain.

Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on it today. 

*'The airship is from China and is civilian in nature, used for meteorological and other scientific research. Due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability, the airship deviated from its intended course.*

*China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the U.S. side to properly handle this accident.'*

Wow, whaddya know, the Intel claiming it was from China was correct, as confirmed by China themselves. The DoD assuming it was a spy device doesn't surprise me, with no other info to go on at the time they had to assume the worst, and it had flown over major US military bases so it's a reasonable first assumption without having more info.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the U.S. side to properly handle this accident.&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, whaddya know, the Intel claiming it was from China was correct, as confirmed by China themselves. The DoD assuming it was a spy device doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me, with no other info to go on at the time they had to assume the worst, and it had flown over major US military bases so it&amp;#39;s a reasonable first assumption without having more info. &lt;/p&gt;

"Every question the reporters ask is replied to with “Ah, can’t go into that”. 

How do you know it’s Chinese? Can’t answer that. 

How big is it? Can’t go into that. 
Is it effective as surveillance? Well it’s just a balloon. So any satellites are more effective.

If the CCP has satellites that are more effective, why would they launch this balloon? Can’t go into that.

Is this balloon weaponized, then? Can’t go into that. Doesn’t appear to be. 

Does the balloon have payload? Is it dangerous? No. 

You said this has happened before, but we don’t have documentation of that. Could you specify when? Can’t go into that. 

Have you contacted the CCP? What are they saying about this? IDK ask them

If this balloon is not a weapon and is useless as surveillance, why should we care? Well it’s violating our airspace.

But you won’t confirm it’s Chinese? Can’t go into that. Very likely Chinese. 

But you won’t confirm? Yes that’s right.

"Building 7 collapsed because huge fucking chunks of the North Tower fell on it, carved a giant gouge out of it, and set it on fire.

Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK. The path of the bullet through Kennedy and Connally is a straight line from the book repository Oswald shot from.

But hey, there really were no WMDs in Iraq! What I’m curious about is how you can think the same government that was so incompetent about blaming Iraq for 9/11 was simultaneously able to mastermind the actual events of 9/11 so perfectly that literally every agency investigating it found it to be a genuine act of terrorism.

"I do. And they're in contact with PRC officials through two different embassies right now trying to sort this situation out.

Is it *possible* that the government is lying about the intel they have on this balloon to spread hate and fear to the general public about China? Anything is possible. However, its unlikely. Why lie about a spy balloon (which has been done in the past multiple times, with intel also pointing back to China on those occasions) when we could focus on \*actual\* issues ie the uyghur situation among others.

That being said, yeah, until they either declassify the sources and release it to the public, or China claims responsibility for the balloon, as you say 'there is no concrete evidence'.","OutOfTheLoop","r/OutOfTheLoop","2023-02-03T07:18:19.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do.

"Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on it today. 

*'The airship is from China and is civilian in nature, used for meteorological and other scientific research. Due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability, the airship deviated from its intended course.*

*China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the U.S. side to properly handle this accident.'*

Wow, whaddya know, the Intel claiming it was from China was correct, as confirmed by China themselves. The DoD assuming it was a spy device doesn't surprise me, with no other info to go on at the time they had to assume the worst, and it had flown over major US military bases so it's a reasonable first assumption without having more info.
