Answer: There is no agreed upon height at where a nation’s airspace ends, but it’s generally accepted to be at the karman line, which is where space begins.

The reason given why they don’t currently want to shoot it down is the risk of debris hurting someone on the ground.

Officials have stated that they don’t believe it’s collecting any data that is sensitive enough to warrant taking it down.

Basically the Chinese just being sky trolls.

Doesn't mean it's a spy. The US government has a tendency to randomly point at anything Chinese (and sometime not even Chinese, just Asian) then baselessly claim it's a spy. Well the vast majority of those are proven to be fault but that doesn't matter because the entire point is to grow anti-Asian racism among the population.

U.S. DoD Senior Defense Official:

*"we are confident that this high-altitude surveillance balloon belongs to the PRC"*

[Link to the briefing](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3287204/senior-defense-official-holds-a-background-briefing-on-high-altitude-surveillan/)  


This also isn't the first time they've done this, happened a few times, including under the previous administration.

#EDIT

I put this in another comment but I'm gonna hijack this one since it's higher in the chain.

Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on it today. 

*'The airship is from China and is civilian in nature, used for meteorological and other scientific research. Due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability, the airship deviated from its intended course.*

*China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the U.S. side to properly handle this accident.'*

Wow, whaddya know, the Intel claiming it was from China was correct, as confirmed by China themselves. The DoD assuming it was a spy device doesn't surprise me, with no other info to go on at the time they had to assume the worst, and it had flown over major US military bases so it's a reasonable first assumption without having more info.

**** *id_t1_j70wp8j *platform_Reddit *phase_Début du fait
I do. And they're in contact with PRC officials through two different embassies right now trying to sort this situation out.

Is it *possible* that the government is lying about the intel they have on this balloon to spread hate and fear to the general public about China? Anything is possible. However, its unlikely. Why lie about a spy balloon (which has been done in the past multiple times, with intel also pointing back to China on those occasions) when we could focus on \*actual\* issues ie the uyghur situation among others.

That being said, yeah, until they either declassify the sources and release it to the public, or China claims responsibility for the balloon, as you say 'there is no concrete evidence'.

**** *id_t1_j713af8 *platform_Reddit *phase_Début du fait
Much of America's nuclear silos are in the midwest. It cuts down the missile travel time a bit while also giving extra time for the US to launch its missiles before enemy nukes strike the silos. Plus the midwest is huge; if the enemy wants to target the silos with nukes, those nukes won't be taking out massive population centres. Montana is one of many midwestern states that have missiles deployed there.

**** *id_t1_j713qfp *platform_Reddit *phase_Début du fait
Balloons are still useful for spying because of their lower altitude. It could be sifting low power radio transmissions or taking high detail photos that a satellite in orbit is too high to effective do, among other things I can’t immediately think of.

Edit: they are also cheap to produce and less likely to cause an international incident than an aircraft invading US airspace.

Every question the reporters ask is replied to with “Ah, can’t go into that”. 

How do you know it’s Chinese? Can’t answer that. 

How big is it? Can’t go into that. 
Is it effective as surveillance? Well it’s just a balloon. So any satellites are more effective.

If the CCP has satellites that are more effective, why would they launch this balloon? Can’t go into that.

Is this balloon weaponized, then? Can’t go into that. Doesn’t appear to be. 

Does the balloon have payload? Is it dangerous? No. 

You said this has happened before, but we don’t have documentation of that. Could you specify when? Can’t go into that. 

Have you contacted the CCP? What are they saying about this? IDK ask them

If this balloon is not a weapon and is useless as surveillance, why should we care? Well it’s violating our airspace.

But you won’t confirm it’s Chinese? Can’t go into that. Very likely Chinese. 

But you won’t confirm? Yes that’s right.

Actually that's it: 15 silos per wing, 45 total, plus a couple testing/training silos at Vandenburg. There are a few treaties restricting the number of missiles and warheads we can have deployed, including required inspections by Russian officials to verify we're within limits. Older silos have been destroyed, demilitarized, or in a couple cases converted into museums with several systems mutilated to prevent the silo from being reactivated.
**** *id_t1_j71q9i6 *platform_Reddit *phase_Début du fait
There are people with very niche expertise in any developed nation's intelligence units.  There's someone at the CIA who can look at a balloon and tell you where it was made.

Answer: The three reasons that have been given for why it’s not being shot down are:

1.	<U+2060>It’s floating above and outside of commercial airspace, and doesn’t pose a risk to aircraft.
2.	<U+2060>It’s believed to be significantly less capable than Chinese spy satellites, and there’s little risk in it collecting any information they don’t already have.
3.	<U+2060>There’s a potential risk to people and property if the balloon is shot from the sky.

"Top Secret" literally means "do not take this home."  

I understand that most of the time they aren't really important.  But how hard is to *not* take home the documents clearly labeled "do not take home" in bright red ink?

I've never had a security clearance, but I've worked in multiple jobs where we had paperwork that wasn't to be taken home or left in the open.  (Privacy issues.)  And guess what?  I *didn't* take those papers home.  *No one* took those papers home.  Not even our stupidest trainees had a problem with "do not remove from premises" documents.  The guy who *glued his hand to a railing* didn't have a problem with following those instructions.  The new girl who mixed bleach and ammonia and caused the whole building to be evacuated didn't have trouble with those instructions.

I'm sorry if I expect better from our elected officials and *our freaking president* than I did from the moron who managed to get his arm stuck in a blood pressure cuff and somehow decided that *cutting off the cuff* was a better solution than unfastening the velcro.

If these people can follow the simple "don't take this home" instructions, then the folks in Washington should be able to manage it.

Answer: Very likely, the government was already aware of such surveillance activities. That's my read on the laxness here. Most likely, they already knew it was coming and adapted accordingly.

Secondly, it's a low-altitude flight, very detectable, hence not a great "spy vessel". If we wanted to troll, we could even fake troop movements, equipment inventory, etc. to make it look like we have military installations and/or equipment in places we don't.

Lastly, shooting aircraft down is risky for anyone living below. Much better to just feed it misinformation.

Answer: This kind of thing happens more often than you’d expect. The balloon itself is easily identifiable, and we can use it for counterintelligence. In other words, we can track its path and move our assets around so they get a false understanding of what they’re seeing. We control their narrative when we know how they’re getting their information. 

In other words, it’s really not a big deal.

The truth of the matter is every nation is spying on us, just as we are spying on every other nation, including out allies. There are spy craft going over America almost every day. 

In all honesty the spies that we know about are are of little concern, since we can easily hide information from them or even feed them false information. 

If we started shooting down spycraft that entered our air space that would just be a signal to everyone that we are hiding something big, thus alerting all the spies that we don't know about.

Even if we had something to hide from this balloon the best course of action is to at least pretend to ignore it. That signals the China that not only is there nothing for them to see in this area, but we are also fully aware of the capabilities of this device so it isn't even worth it to check it out.

Basically:

There's near-zero chance US intelligence didn't know of the balloon *long* before it got near the continent (hell, we probably knew of it the moment it was launched)

If it was believed to be a threat, it would have been shot down ages ago.

&amp;#x200B;

*Whatever* it is that it's doing, the military has deemed it not worth shooting down. If the military thinks it's fine to leave up there...then it's probably fine to leave up there. They'd know ***significantly*** more about threat assessment than me.

We should probably worry more if they *do* shoot it down.

It’s at like 90,000 feet iirc and balloons have basically no infrared signature (like a satellite does). So they’re actually hard to aim at. The highest an F22 goes is supposedly under 70,000 feet. 

Bullets you shoot and miss with come down at high speeds. So do explosives payloads. So do the chunks of balloon if it does get hit. Also there’s just no reason to shoot it down?? So why bother? It’s all risk and no reward to shoot down some balloon that isn’t even doing any useful spying.

Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on it today. 

*'The airship is from China and is civilian in nature, used for meteorological and other scientific research. Due to the influence of westerly winds and its limited control capability, the airship deviated from its intended course.*

*China regrets that the airship strayed into the United States by mistake due to force majeure. China will continue to maintain communication with the U.S. side to properly handle this accident.'*

Wow, whaddya know, the Intel claiming it was from China was correct, as confirmed by China themselves. The DoD assuming it was a spy device doesn't surprise me, with no other info to go on at the time they had to assume the worst, and it had flown over major US military bases so it's a reasonable first assumption without having more info.

I wrote notes in a classified secret room for my military school once.  The notes were automatically labeled as secret because of the room we were in even though the lesson being taught was unclassified. So, I had to wait for them to "scrub" my notes before taking them back to my work so I could use them. 

My point here is, yes, it is extremely easy to take home classified documents. I didn't have to wait, I could have just accidentally forgot and kept it in my pocket. I'm not trying to come into the defense of people who have monkey loads of documents here, but I'd imagine that everything a vice president or president does is automatically labeled as classified until deemed otherwise. So, it's an acceptable assumption to make that this would indeed affect everyone. 

Our security improves yearly. I know this because it's super annoying for me..I hate all the rules. So, yea, everyone at this point probably has some form of a classified document in their basement. (Government officials wise)

It means a fleet of weather balloons drifted off course. In my opinion the US is using all of this to plant the seed of a war with china in its people. China is 100% already spying on the US with sattelites, spies, tiktok ect... The idea that they would use the worlds most visible hot air balloon to spy on a country kinda seems implausible to me.

The balloon was surely picked up on radar before it hit alaska and canada. They could have shot it down before all of this but instead they let it fly into the mainland and told the media to go wild. 

If they truly believed it to be a national security risk it wouldve never been seen and we wouldn't hear a peep.

Then again, this is just my opinion.
**** *id_t1_j7c0gai *platform_Reddit *phase_Pic du fait
&gt;First off. You can't shoot down a satellite...It's in an mutually agreed upon international airspace. Even if you did, it would spread the debris everywhere, causing all sorts of issues for all other satellites. And it's literally never been done before to another countries satellite. Lol.

You *can* as in it's [technically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test) [possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Burnt_Frost). And China occasionally likes to do things that come off as a bit rude, like deorbiting space stuff and not worrying about where it falls...

It's necessary.  Things in orbit have to travel at very fast speeds relative to other things not in similar orbits.  So fast that even debris measured in cm is super dangerous.  And within the atmosphere, it's even more necessary to actively track man made objects for various reasons.  You dont want to be in a position where China or some other nation launches some air vehicle that you don't track until its 3/4 of the way across the Pacific.

I live in downtown Charleston SC, and I remember hearing a TON of people start cheering all around my house on 2/4. 

I was super confused until I googled “what just happened in Charleston, SC?”

I guess a bunch of students found out that it was about to be shot down, and watched it.

Most of the US nuclear missile silos are in northern central states like Montana, the Dakotas, Nebraska etc and the balloon flew right over them. I imagine they're fairly well hidden, so they might've needed higher resolution photography than their satellites could provide.

There was no spy balloon. 

[Now, seven months later, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tells "CBS News Sunday Morning" the balloon wasn't spying. "The intelligence community, their assessment – and it's a high-confidence assessment – [is] that there was no intelligence collection by that balloon," he said.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-bizarre-secret-behind-chinas-spy-balloon/)
**** *id_t1_kt7xrvx *platform_Reddit *phase_Après débunkage du fait
Confusing statements but he does say it was a spy balloon but didn’t do any intelligence gathering. 

Milley replied, "I would say it was a spy balloon that we know with high degree of certainty got no intelligence, and didn't transmit any intelligence back to China."

Are these sincere questions? Because we can discuss why high altitude surveillance balloons have advantages over the usage of a satellites. It's a very low cost/barrier to entry means of espionage; especially for a second world  developing nations. 

The more pressing concern is the likelihood that they were used in conjunction with incendiary devices to cause the Alberta and California wildfires.

Because we could spy on the spy ballon. 

Because it would be easier to recover parts intact after a water landing. 

Because we knew where it was going so we could move, hide, shut down secrets stuff before it got there.

Because it was the size of a bus and we didn’t want to have it fall on someone.

Of course they say that. Why admit to such a failure? Reality is that the spyballoon did in fact gather intelligence only for the US to have mitigated the risk

&gt; Following the April 2023 Pentagon document leaks, The Washington Post uncovered additional information from a trove of classified files on Discord that had previously not been reported.[29] They include U.S. assessment of the Chinese balloon's power generation capability (up to 10,000 watts), which would be sufficient to operate synthetic-aperture radar equipment if carried on board, and how parts of the Chinese government were surprised by the balloon's North American incursion, judging from intercepted communications. U.S. intelligence had been aware of four other similar balloons, one of which had flown over a Nimitz carrier strike group in western Pacific, while another had crashed in the South China Sea. The documents did not date those incidents. The Pentagon and the Office of National Intelligence declined to comment.[29]

&gt; In June, preliminary investigation by the U.S. reported the presence of reconnaissance equipment on board the balloon downed in February. There were conflicting reports on whether it had collected any intelligence during its flight.[198][199] It does not appear to have sent anything back to China. The Wall Street Journal said the balloon carried off-the-shelf U.S. gear.[4] Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick S. Ryder did not confirm that information but said that Chinese drones in the past have utilized off-the-shelf U.S. equipment.[4] **He also said that mitigation efforts "contributed" to the balloon not collecting any intelligence while transiting or overflying the United States**.[200]

It truly is incredible how much the mostly U.S. population on this website have managed to be so brainwashed into believing China is some completely evil country. I have plenty of issues with them myself but that doesn't mean I believe propaganda from either side.

I mean, all high-altitude weather balloons look like that whether used for spying or weather. They are not good spy platforms in 2024 because they are incredibly easy to spot and track. So easy that after this incident we shot down a university project's balloon that belonged to our own country.

You can literally find those silos on Google Earth, their locations are not a secret, and they are fairly obvious because once you know what one looks like, all the others look the same. Yes, Google does sometimes censor things, but this is not one of them. Those locations have been public knowledge for decades now. Also all of our ammo stockpiles and other things are clearly visible from publicly available satellite imagery.
