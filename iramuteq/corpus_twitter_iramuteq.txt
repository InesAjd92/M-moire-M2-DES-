<U+26D3><U+FE0F>Project CAPTURE: DARPA's Pursuit of UAP Biologics? <U+0001FABC>

In response to the 2023 Chinese Spy Balloon incident, DARPA initiated Project CAPTURE (Capturing Aerial Payloads to Unleash Reliable Exploitation) with publicly stated goals of intercepting high-altitude objects. However, deeper analysis suggests the project may also aim to capture and study Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), particularly those with potential biological characteristics.

   Technical Specifications and UAP Context
Project CAPTURE is designed to manage payloads weighing between 500 and 1,500 pounds. This range is notably lower than typical spy balloons, such as the 2,000-pound Chinese Weather Balloon or NASA’s 8,000-pound ultra-long-duration balloons. This weight limit suggests an interest in lighter objects, potentially indicative of biological UAPs. Additionally, the project's capacity to capture "entire aerial systems" while preserving their condition hints at an underlying focus on intact biological retrievals.

   Hypothesis: Capturing Organic UAPs
The project’s mandate to avoid populated areas during captures serves dual purposes: public safety and maintaining secrecy around UAP captures. The emphasis on capturing aerial systems in their entirety, while maximizing their condition, points towards the potential retrieval and study of biological entities. Reports of UAPs like @JeremyCorbell's "Jellyfish UAP," described as slow-moving and scale-like, align with the types of objects Project CAPTURE seems equipped to handle.

   Implications and Future Directions
The potential that DARPA’s Project CAPTURE is tailored for the retrieval of biological UAPs suggests a significant shift in military and research priorities. If these captures include organic components, it would revolutionize our understanding of UAPs and their implications for science, technology, and public awareness. This possibility calls for further scrutiny and open discourse on the true objectives of Project CAPTURE and its broader implications for humanity's engagement with unknown aerial phenomena.

Oh, there was Biden allowing a Chinese spy balloon to traverse the entire continental US. Oh, there was the most disgusting withdrawal of the US from any country in our nation's history with Afghanistan while men fell out of wheel wells of planes, and girls were ripped from schools and women were beaten publicly in the streets but Biden is for women's rights! Your candidate is an abysmal failure. Your party went crazy and spent its precious time in charge pushing a woke agenda down the throats of parents across the country and they pushed back. Biden didn't even know where his secretary of defense was for 5 days when over 50 of our middle easter military bases were being attacked. He's an idiot. Under Trump we had zero wars. Under Biden we are on the verge of WW3 with the worst economy of my lifetime and I'm OLD!

I wanted to share with you several points from an interview that Garry Kasparov, chess grandmaster and political activist, gave Zahid. net media:

<U+25FE><U+FE0F>"NATO was created for one purpose - to protect free Europe from Russian aggression. Today, Ukraine is the only country fighting for the main purpose for which NATO was created. Ukraine is already a member of NATO. It has shed so much blood to fulfill NATO's purpose."

<U+25FE><U+FE0F>"China's position is quite clear - it needs the war to continue indefinitely because it weakens both Russia, as China has it in for it, and the West. It needs a situation in which Xi Jinping will control the process and choose the right moment to attack Taiwan."

<U+25FE><U+FE0F>"They [Russia] need to realize that they have to build the country differently and that the choice is to be a Chinese province of raw materials or to return to Europe on other terms."

Thankful to @Kasparov63 for supporting Ukraine!

Trump, not Joe*

Joe has weaponized the justice system. That is tyranny. Btw, when in your life was an ex president prosecuted in unison leading up to election? Or better yet, when in your life was a Chinese spy balloon allowed to go over the ENTIRE U.S.? 

Wake up and open your eyes old man. You can like endless wars and death all you want but don’t act like Joe Biden has done one single thing for America in his entire life. Zero accomplishments. If he didn’t have TDS, he would have nothing and he certainly wouldn’t have the office. I challenge you to look at Hunter Biden’s laptop. The evidence of corrupt would make your head spin. Do that since you are such a vigilante. Of course you won’t. 

I take that back, if he didn’t have TDS inflicted people like you, Joe would have Kamala <U+0001F602>. Now there is an accomplished VP. <U+0001F921>

JUST IN: In newly released exclusive video from January 6, Chuck Schumer demands a “good f**king reason” for  Trump doing nothing for hours as they remained trapped in the Capitol. 

Every American needs to be reminded about this travesty. Trump is and was a traitor. 

In the footage, Schumer vented his fury at an Army official:

“D.C. has requested the National Guard, and it’s been denied by DOD. I’d like to know a good f*cking reason why it’s been denied,” Schumer can be seen telling then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy on the phone. “We need them fast. We’ve all had to, I’ve never seen anything like this. We’re like a third-world country here. We had to run and evacuate the Capitol.”

Remember, Trump called insurrectionists “warriors.”

Share this everywhere to remind voters that Donald Trump should never set foot in the White House ever again.

What makes me nervous is, they found a map on HB laptop with our military bases, electric grids, etc in Chinese! Then this balloon appeared & flies over almost ALL of them. Now our military are being hacked almost daily, Chinese migrants caught on bases. Nobody reports it or …

Leftists hated plastic drinking straws worse than Biden’s plastic helmet hitting the ground and the plastic on the Chinese spy balloon the size of 3 buses. Done in the words of “follow the science” so obviously the media sucks for that to be what goes on about…

Man who loves-little girls
Man who care by letting child sex trafficking southern border

You're either insane or a paid shill for the Democrat party. Which one is it? Let America know. Because nobody in their right mind is voting for this ESPECIALLY when he's allowed Russian nuclear warships to sail off the The coast of Florida and Chinese spy balloons over the USA<U+0001F447>

BS. Let me ask you a serious question. The DOJ found a US map on HB laptop written in Chinese. Pointing out military bases, power grids etc. Then a spy balloon just happens to fly over those areas. Now our military gets hacked weekly along with Chinese migrants illegally….

So what will Biden do about it?  

He let a Chinese spy balloon traverse the entire U.S., said “Don’t “ to deter his buddies in Iran, built a pier for Hamas that only lasted 2 weeks and is building them another one…

Will he sanction more Russian oligarchs, once again excluding those that sent his son millions?

But our government says that this is a nothing burger. Well, that ranks right up there with the Chinese Balloons that crossed over our military bases transmitting sensitive military information back to the CCP, then as soon as it when over the Atlantic Ocean Biden had it shot down. Look at all the different stories we got from our company about that.

I no longer trust Joe Biden and his administration to tell us the truth and I don't trust them to protect us. They're the type of government that will show up to the party late and say better late than never.

It's a real shame that they're more interested in letting in illegal immigrants, protection illegal immigrants and giving illegal immigrants free housing, free medical, free food, free money and free schooling.

Placing Americans at risk are the actions of a Chinese spy, like the balloon <U+0001F388> <U+0001F604> <U+0001F923> floating all sorts of ideas.

You really think that? America hasn’t won a war since WWII when Russia did 85% of the work. And they couldn’t even  track the Chinese balloons that floated over 2/3 of the country

Why is anyone surprised when Biden let a China balloon cross our country and did nothing!!!
Now thousands of Chinese have entered our country and let go.
